# Color Schemes Generator

Uses [pickr](https://github.com/Simonwep/pickr) for color selection & [tinycolor](https://github.com/bgrins/TinyColor) for color manipulation.

Currently provides the following color schemes: 
* Analogous
* Monochromatic
* Complementary
* Split Complementary
* Triad
* Tetrad
May add more at a later date.

Demo available [here](https://wmlol.github.io/color-schemes-generator/).
